# Regicide

This repo contains both the back and front-end code for a digital version of the card game [regicide](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/badgersfrommars/regicide), where 2 - 4 players take it in turns to play cards and try and defeat the cardboard monarchy. It can be played with a 52 card playing deck or online at (wherever I end up hosting this project)
